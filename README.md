Hi, I'm @Cesroket
I’m a bioinformatician from Spain with a focus on environmental genomics. Now I´m learning git, so I would appreciate any advice. 

My professional work: 

**Enterovirus surveillance through wastewater-based epidemiology.
**SARS-CoV-2 monitoring to track viral spread in populations.
**Metagenomics studies to explore microbial communities and their functional roles.
**Surveillance and detection of priority pathogens through NGS.

Feel free to explore my repositories, or reach out for collaborations.
